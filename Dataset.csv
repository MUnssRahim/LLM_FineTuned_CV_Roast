"Game developer using Unity and C# for 2D and 3D games.","Your game has amazing potential, a great trailer, and absolutely no players. Physics bugs are now considered 'features.'"
"Software engineer with strong object-oriented programming skills in Java.","Ah yes, 15 classes for a problem that needed 2. Your design patterns are impressive—mostly because no one understands them."
"Data engineer building ETL pipelines using Airflow and Spark.","You move data from one place to another, slowly and expensively. Spark runs because the cluster is huge, not because your code is good."
"Frontend developer focused on HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript.","You center divs for a living and still need Stack Overflow. The UI looks great until someone opens it on a different screen size."
"NLP engineer working on text classification and sentiment analysis models.","You trained BERT to tell happy from sad and called it NLP mastery. The model works—until someone uses sarcasm. Oh wait."
"AI product engineer integrating LLMs into real-world applications.","You wrapped an API call in a backend and branded it as AI innovation. When the API rate-limits you, the product mysteriously stops existing."

"Blockchain developer experienced in Solidity and smart contract development.","You wrote one smart contract and now talk like you're decentralizing humanity. Meanwhile, your contract has more security holes than Swiss cheese."
"Site reliability engineer experienced in monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana.","You built dashboards that look amazing while the servers burn in the background. At least the outage graphs will be visually pleasing."
"AI engineer specializing in TensorFlow and deep learning model deployment.","You spent three weeks fighting TensorFlow version conflicts just to deploy a model that PyTorch users finished last Tuesday."
"Unity VR developer building immersive virtual reality applications.","You make people dizzy professionally. Half your users remove the headset after five minutes and never come back."
"Quantitative analyst using Python and statistical modeling for financial forecasting.","You predicted stock prices using linear regression like it's 1995. The market laughed and took your backtesting results with it."
"Bioinformatics developer analyzing genomic datasets using Python and R.","You process DNA faster than you understand it. Half your scripts are just guessing and hoping the biological meaning figures itself out."
"Android developer specializing in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.","You replaced XML with Compose and call it innovation, yet your app still crashes when someone rotates their phone."
"iOS developer experienced in Swift and UIKit.","You obsess over pixel-perfect animations while your app consumes battery like it’s mining crypto in the background."
"Computer graphics engineer working with OpenGL and shader programming.","You spend hours optimizing shaders so that three people can admire your spinning cube at 240 FPS."
"AR developer using ARKit and ARCore for augmented reality experiences.","You place virtual furniture in rooms no one asked to decorate. The tracking drifts harder than your career focus."
"Big data engineer working with Hadoop and distributed storage systems.","You maintain systems that exist only because someone was afraid of deleting old data. Congratulations, you babysit clusters."
"Natural language processing engineer using spaCy and transformers.","You tokenize text and pretend you're teaching machines language. Meanwhile, your preprocessing pipeline removes half the meaning."
"QA automation engineer writing Selenium and Cypress test suites.","You write tests that fail randomly and call it edge-case coverage. Half your time is updating selectors after UI changes."
"Hardware engineer designing FPGA-based systems using Verilog.","You debug timing issues for weeks just to blink LEDs faster. Your simulations work perfectly—hardware disagrees violently."
"Network engineer specializing in Cisco routing and switching.","You configure routers using commands that look like ancient spells. One typo and suddenly half the company loses internet."
"Game AI developer implementing behavior trees and pathfinding algorithms.","Your NPCs either act like geniuses or run into walls repeatedly. Somehow both behaviors still outperform your debugging skills."
